I’ve developed a chat software based on Intel's official libraries, currently in its early stages. If you're looking for a chat application, feel free to try it out!

Key Features:

    Intel-Based Infrastructure – The software relies on Intel’s official libraries, so it only supports systems with Intel GPUs or CPUs.

    Built-in Mainstream Tools – Includes various commonly used utilities for convenience.

    MCP Support – Compatible with MCP (Intel’s Management and Control Platform).

Give it a test run and share your feedback!
